DECTools v. 1.0

DecEnc:
DecEnc is just a module you use. The end...
If you want to use that instead of DECTools, use this command guide.
=======================DECENC COMMANDS GUIDE=============================
I. Decypher (decrupting files)
There is 2 modes for decypher though:
1. BRUTEFORCE
2. Classic (password or without)
to do bruteforce, use this:
---
py -3 -m decenc decypher [ENCRYPTED FILE] --brute
---
Classic ones:
---
# Solve given password, output to kenobi.txt
python decenc.py decypher kenobi.dec <redacted> -o kenobi
cat kenobi.dec | python decenc.py decypher - <redacted> -o kenobi

# Decrypt a double layer encrypted file with no password
py -3 -m decenc.py decypher twolayer.dec -n2
---
RETURNING THINGS INTO A FILE:
use -o flag to do that
EXAMPLE:
---
py -3 -m decenc decypher NoWay.dec -o NoWay-Decypher.txt ## Creates file NoWay-Decypher with decrypted contents of NoWay.dec
---
About layers:
Layers is layers.
Just use -nX flag, lol
(-n2 for example, see above to see a small example)

DECTools: they're just DECTools, just do the thing BRUH
